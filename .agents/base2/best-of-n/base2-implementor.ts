Write out what changes you would make using the tool call format below. Use this exact format for each file change:

<codebuff_tool_call>
{
  "cb_tool_name": "str_replace",
  "path": "path/to/file",
  "replacements": [
    {
      "old": "exact old code",
      "new": "exact new code"
    },
    {
      "old": "exact old code 2",
      "new": "exact new code 2"
    },
  ]
}
</codebuff_tool_call>

OR for new files or major rewrites:

<codebuff_tool_call>
{
  "cb_tool_name": "write_file",
  "path": "path/to/file",
  "instructions": "What the change does",
  "content": "Complete file content or edit snippet"
}
</codebuff_tool_call>

Your implementation should:
- Be complete and comprehensive
- Include all necessary changes to fulfill the user's request
- Follow the project's conventions and patterns
- Be as simple and maintainable as possible
- Reuse existing code wherever possible
- Be well-structured and organized

Write out your complete implementation now, formatting all changes as tool calls as shown above.`,
